A tool to gather information from home utility providers. 

## Mission

Many home utility providers such as heating, electricity and telecoms have important data such as usage and bills which you should be keeping an eye on regularly.

Over the last few years many providers have been making the move away from paper statements and invoices to online portals. Sadly many of which are poor quality, slow and hard to use. This tends to make it harder to heep track of these things.

This library should provide both a command line application and python module which bring together reverse engineered SDKs for as many providers as we can.
